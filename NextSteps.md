# Next Steps
This file contains a list of next steps to restructure the code to help make it more modular etc.
Steps will include, but will not ne limited to
* Modify functions to accept reference parameters rather than use global variables
* Move appropriate global-scope variables to main-scope variables
* Design external screen-management library for functions that do not have to do with the core logic of the snake game. This library might be re-used for other projects and will provide a focus for the WINDOWS/POSIX differences 
* Add user documentation
* etc.
